üíº Employee Salary Classification using Machine Learning:
This project focuses on predicting whether an employee earns more than 50K annually based on several input features using machine learning classification models. The dataset contains structured information such as age, education, occupation, hours worked per week, and years of experience. The goal is to build a robust classification pipeline that can generalize well to new employee data and offer insights for workforce analytics or HR systems.

üìÅ Project Overview
The project follows a complete machine learning lifecycle:

Data Preprocessing
The dataset includes both numerical and categorical columns. Appropriate encoding (e.g., One-Hot Encoding for categorical data) and scaling (e.g., StandardScaler for numerical features) are applied to ensure consistency during model training and inference.

Model Training & Evaluation
Several models were evaluated including:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Gradient Boosting

These models are trained using a Pipeline that combines preprocessing and classification steps, ensuring compatibility and reproducibility.

Best Model Selection
The model with the highest accuracy is selected and saved using joblib for later use. Evaluation metrics like accuracy score and classification report are used to compare performances.

Prediction Functionality
The saved model can be used to make predictions on:

A single employee‚Äôs data (manually entered)

A batch of employee records from a CSV file

üõ† Technologies Used
Python

pandas, NumPy

scikit-learn (for ML modeling, pipelines, and evaluation)

joblib (for saving and loading models)

üöÄ Future Improvements
Add data visualization for EDA and model insights

Integrate feature importance interpretation

Develop a full-fledged user interface or API for easier use
